<h1 id="Integrating-python-scripts-into-bash-scripts">Integrating python scripts into bash scripts<a class="anchor-link" href="#Integrating-python-scripts-into-bash-scripts">&#182;</a></h1><p>One important functionality in Unix is the ability to creat analysis pipelines in which several commands can be executed in one go. You have already been using this functionality when you use pipes (<code>|</code>) and redirects (<code>&gt;</code>) in Unix. For example, the command</p>

<pre><code>cat filename.txt|tr -s " " ","|cut -d "," -f 2|sort|uniq -c| sort -n</code></pre>
<p>is actually the series of commands "print the contents of <code>filename.txt</code> onto the terminal screen, send it to the <code>tr</code> command where spaces (squeezed to one) are replaced with commas; send the output with the commas to <code>cut</code>, where we will extract the second column; send the colum to sort; send the sorted column to uniq; send the output of uniq to sort again to numerically sort.</p>
<p>You hava also learned how to write basc scripts that will execute all those commands in one go. Recall the structure of bash scripts:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
cat $1|tr -s " " ","|cut -d "," -f 2|sort|uniq -c| sort -n</code></pre>
<p>If the script above is saved as <code>unique_sorter.sh</code> and has the right permissions, we can run <code>unique_counter.sh &lt;filename&gt;</code> to execute the long series of commands on any file.</p>
<h3 id="To-Do">To-Do<a class="anchor-link" href="#To-Do">&#182;</a></h3><p>Write a shell script that meets the following requirements:</p>

<pre><code>1. The script should be called replace_newlines.sh
2. The script should be saved in your ~/scripts/ folder and should be executible from any directory
3. The script should take a file as its input and replace all Windows carriage returns (i.e. \r) with Unix newlines (i.e. \n)
4. The script should write the propperly formatted file as "formatted_&lt;oldname&gt;"</code></pre>
<p>Once the script is written, you should be able to execute <code>replace_newlines.sh nature21074-f1.csv</code> and notice that the file <code>formatted_nature21074-f1.csv</code> is saved in the same directory.</p>
<h2 id="Shell-scripts-can-combine-Unix-and-Python-scripts!">Shell scripts can combine Unix and Python scripts!<a class="anchor-link" href="#Shell-scripts-can-combine-Unix-and-Python-scripts!">&#182;</a></h2><h3 id="But-first,-some-preliminaries.">But first, some preliminaries.<a class="anchor-link" href="#But-first,-some-preliminaries.">&#182;</a></h3><h4 id="Python-outside-of-iPyNBs">Python outside of iPyNBs<a class="anchor-link" href="#Python-outside-of-iPyNBs">&#182;</a></h4><p>So far in this course we have worked in jupyter notebooks, which provide a nice interactive way to work with python. But a more computationally powerful way of using python is to write scripts that run in the background without our attention. Here is an example of a small script that simply prints a hello-world line. Copy the following code into a new file within your <code>exercise-6</code> folder called <code>my-first-script.py</code>.</p>

<pre><code>print("Hello world! I'm using python!")
var1 = 2+3
print("Var1 is " + var1)</code></pre>
<p>Within your terminal, add execution permissions to this file (using <code>chmod</code>) and run the script. Since this script is not saved in your <code>~/scripts</code> folder, you will need to run the script using <code>python ./my-first-script.py</code>.</p>
<p>Since it's not a bash script (notice that there is no shebang (i.e. <code>!# /bin/bash</code> or similar), we need to tell the shell to run the script using python.</p>
<p>You can convert iPyNBs into base python scripts by opening your jupyter notebook and navigating to File -&gt; Download As -&gt; python</p>
<h4 id="An-introduction-to-argument-parsing-in-python">An introduction to argument parsing in python<a class="anchor-link" href="#An-introduction-to-argument-parsing-in-python">&#182;</a></h4><p>Recall that we can give variables to a unix script in the format <code>script_name.sh &lt;var1&gt; &lt;var2&gt; ... &lt;varN&gt;</code> and retrieve the contents of <code>var1</code>...<code>varN</code> with <code>$1...$N</code>.</p>
<p>We can do the same (almost) with python scripts- for example, we can write a python script such that if we execute <code>python script_name.py file.txt</code>, <code>file.txt</code> is sent as the first argument to the script <code>script_name.py</code>. <strong><em>Exciting</em></strong>, right!(?)</p>
<p>Let us consider the following python script, that always prints out the sentence "Hi. My name is Gaurav, I like oranges".</p>

<pre><code># define variables
name = "Gaurav"
fav_fruit = "oranges"

# print a sentence using the variables
print("Hi. My name is "+ name+ ", I like " + fav_fruit)</code></pre>
<p>Let's save the script as <code>name_fav.py</code> in <code>exercise-6</code>, make it executible, and run it using <code>python ./name_fav.py</code>. You should see the sentence <code>Hi. My name is Gaurav, I like oranges</code> printed onto your terminal. But the truth is that when <strong>you</strong> are running the script, the name and fav_fruit are wrong! Your name isn't Gaurav, and your favorite fruit might not be oranges. We should really have a script that lets you input your own arguments! Wouldn't it be nice if we could just run <code>python ./name_fav.py &lt;your_name&gt; &lt;your_fav_fruit&gt;</code> and have it be customized to you?</p>
<p>We can do that using the <code>sys.argv</code> tool in python:</p>

<pre><code># import in the sys module that contains the function argv
import sys

# define variables
name = sys.argv[1]
fav_fruit = sys.argv[2]

# print a sentence using the variables
print("Hi. My name is "+ name+ ", I like " + fav_fruit)</code></pre>
<p>In this script, the variable <code>name</code> takes on the value of the first argument supplied by the user; the variable <code>fav_fruit</code> takes on the value of the second argument. If this script is saved as <code>nam_fav_w_variables.py</code> and has the right permissions, we can run the command <code>python ./name_fav_w_variables.py Rujuta papaya</code>, and the sentence "Hi, name is Rujuta, I like papaya" is printed to the terminal.</p>

However, we can make use these variables to read in a file of the users choosing!</p>
<p>For example, the following python script prints out the first line of any file that the user asks the script to work on:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
file_to_read = sys.argv[1]
in_file = open(file_to_read)

print("The first line of the file " + file_to_read + " is \n" + in_file.readline()")
in_file.close()</code></pre>
<p>If the file is saved as <code>first_line_reader.py</code>, and has execute permissions, we can run <code>python ./first_line_reader.py &lt;file_name&gt;</code> to print the first line of a file.</p>

After we downloaded the dataset, we had to do several modifications (replacing the newline characters, replacing the extraneous commas with <code>sed</code>) and then we ran the file through a python script. In this section you will learn how to make a single shell script that will go through all of those steps at once.</p>
<p>We will build up this script one step at a time. Save the script as <code>ebird_summarizer.sh</code> in your <code>exercise-6</code> folder.</p>
<h5 id="Step-1:-Write-a-shell-script-that-uses-our-function-replace_newlines-to-modify-the-raw-data">Step 1: Write a shell script that uses our function replace_newlines to modify the raw data<a class="anchor-link" href="#Step-1:-Write-a-shell-script-that-uses-our-function-replace_newlines-to-modify-the-raw-data">&#182;</a></h5><p>Earlier in this exercise we saved the function <code>replace_newlines.sh</code> in <code>~/scripts</code>. We can first use that to clean up the file.</p>

<pre><code>#! /bin/bash
# the next line will create a new file called formatted_eBird_data.csv
replace_newlines.sh eBird_data.csv</code></pre>
<p>Executing just this script will create a new file called <code>formatted_eBird_data.csv</code> with all <code>\r</code>s replaced with <code>\n</code>s.</p>
<h5 id="Step-2:-Modify-the-shell-script-to-also-remove-extraneous-commas-and-strange-characters-in-the-first-line">Step 2: Modify the shell script to also remove extraneous commas and strange characters in the first line<a class="anchor-link" href="#Step-2:-Modify-the-shell-script-to-also-remove-extraneous-commas-and-strange-characters-in-the-first-line">&#182;</a></h5><p>That's a start, but we will now expand this script to also replace all <code>,</code> (i.e. comma-space) with <code></code> (i.e. space):</p>

<pre><code>#! /bin/bash
# the next line will create a new file called formatted_eBird_data.csv
replace_newlines.sh eBird_data.csv
# the next line will replace all extra commas and will replace the contents of formatted_eBird_data.csv
sed 's/,\s/ /g` formatted_eBird_data.csv &gt; formatted_eBird_data.csv</code></pre>
<h5 id="Step-3:-Write-a-python-script-that-will-processes-data">Step 3: Write a python script that will processes data<a class="anchor-link" href="#Step-3:-Write-a-python-script-that-will-processes-data">&#182;</a></h5><p>Let's assume that you have a python script called <code>does_something.py</code>. You can now add this onto your shell script so that you end up with a single script that does the replacements, AND the python work, all in one go!</p>

<pre><code>#! /bin/bash
# the next line will create a new file called formatted_eBird_data.csv
replace_newlines.sh eBird_data.csv
# the next line will replace all extra commas and will replace the contents of formatted_eBird_data.csv
sed 's/,\s/ /g` formatted_eBird_data.csv &gt; reformatted_eBird_data.csv
python does_something.py reformatted_eBird_data.csv</code></pre>
