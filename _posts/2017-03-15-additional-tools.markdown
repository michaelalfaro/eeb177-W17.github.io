So far in this course you have learned many tools that we hope will get you started on any practical computing task you might encounter. This week we will explore a few modern tools that are super helpful general-purpose tools for all practical computing.

### Combining LaTeX, markdown, and R

You have already been using RMarkdown to make documents that contain text narrative written in Markdown and `R` code. RStudio allows us to seemlessly incorporate \LaTeX functionality into these RMarkdown documents. There are many reasons why this is helpful- for example, you may have an equation-heavy project that can benefit from the beautiful typesetting of LaTeX, or you might want to exploit the bibliography management that BiBTeX offers. 

Before we get this going, we need to install a few extra LaTeX packages onto the VirtualBox (NB: If, later on, you are using your own Mac or PC to create these documents from RStudio, you may not need to perform this step- it all depends on your specific install of LaTeX). Execute the following lines from the terminal:

```
# this installation will take some time (~4-5 minutes?)
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra

# restart
sudo reboot
```

After the reboot, use your terminal to create an `exercise-10` directory within your `lab-work` directory. Navigate into the newly created `exercise-10` directory and launch RStudio. 

Create a new RMarkdown file (as you have been doing), but change the default output to a `PDF document`:

![rmd2pdf]({{ site.url }}/images/exercise10-rmd2pdf.png)

Clear the demo code that is generated by RStudio- we are writing our own reports and don't need their training wheels any more!

Replace the dummy text generated by RStudio with the text in the following code block. 

## NOTE 

I have written a demo document to include many different types of LaTeX and R functionalities that you might like to use for your final reports or for other projects in the future- **Please read through the text carefully, as you can later use this document as a model for your own reports**!. You can retrieve the document, as well as some supplementary documents (a bibliography and a style sheet) using wget from within the `exercise-10` directory:

```
wget -O demo-document.Rmd https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eeb177-W17/eeb177-W17.github.io/master/hw_files/demo-document.Rmd
wget -O biblio.bib https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eeb177-W17/eeb177-W17.github.io/master/hw_files/biblio.bib
wget -O ecology-letters.csl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eeb177-W17/eeb177-W17.github.io/master/hw_files/ecology-letters.csl
```

Open `demo-document.Rmd` using RStudio from the `exercise-10` directory. You should now be able to knit the document by clicking the knit button as usual (*note*: you can also knit a file using `control+shift+K`). A document named `demo-document.pdf` should be created within the `exercise-10` directory. 

Congrats! You have now made a beautifully typeset PDF report that includes R code, images, citations, and figures- all pretty much written in Markdown!
